# Responsive-Portfolio

Overview

Create two different portfolios. The first will be an update to Basic Portfolio. Make enhancements to the portfolio  with a mobile-responsive layout. Write media queries at the bottom of the styles.css doc; use three @media screen tags, each with one of these max-widths: 980px, 768px and 640px.

For the second portfolio, a layout will be built using the Bootstrap CSS framework. This Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.
